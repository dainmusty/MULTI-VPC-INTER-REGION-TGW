2. Why toset() in for_each?

for_each needs either:

a map ({ key = value })

or a set of strings (toset([...]))

It does not allow a plain list, because lists are indexed (0, 1, 2...) and those aren‚Äôt stable keys across runs.

So if you pass a list(string) to for_each, Terraform will complain:

The "for_each" map includes keys derived from resource addresses, which is not allowed.


That‚Äôs why we wrap lists with toset() ‚Äî it converts the list into a set of strings, which Terraform can safely use as keys.

3. Your case

Since you declared:

variable "tgw_arns" {
  type = list(string)
}


And then wrote:

for_each = toset(var.tgw_arns)


Terraform converts that list ‚Üí set.
That way each TGW ARN becomes a unique key in the loop.

‚úÖ TL;DR:

Square brackets [] = list.

toset([...]) = set.

for_each doesn‚Äôt accept lists directly, so we wrap with toset().

Do you also want me to extend this so the target account(s) can automatically accept the share (using aws_ram_resource_share_accepter + provider aliases with assume_role), or do you want to keep that separate?



 The "for_each" set includes values derived from resource attributes that cannot be   
‚îÇ determined until apply, and so Terraform cannot determine the full set of keys that  
‚îÇ will identify the instances of this resource.
‚îÇ
‚îÇ When working with unknown values in for_each, it's better to use a map value where   
‚îÇ the keys are defined statically in your configuration and where only the values      
‚îÇ contain apply-time results.
‚îÇ
‚îÇ Alternatively, you could use the -target planning option to first apply only the     
‚îÇ resources that the for_each value depends on, and then apply a second time to fully  
‚îÇ converge.

ChatGPT said:

Ah, this is the same "for_each with unknown values at plan time" problem we saw earlier with TGW attachments üëç.

Terraform can‚Äôt build a toset(var.tgw_arns) because the ARNs (module.tgw_*.tgw_arn) don‚Äôt exist until apply time.

‚úÖ Fix: use a map instead of a list

Instead of passing a list of TGW ARNs, pass a map with static keys (the values can still be dynamic). That way, Terraform always knows the keys at plan time.

Child module (modules/ram-share/main.tf)
resource "aws_ram_resource_association" "resource_assoc" {
  for_each = var.tgw_arns

  resource_arn       = each.value
  resource_share_arn = aws_ram_resource_share.tgw_share.arn
}

Variables (modules/ram-share/variables.tf)
variable "tgw_arns" {
  description = "Map of TGW ARNs to share"
  type        = map(string)
}

Root module call

Instead of:

tgw_arns = [module.tgw_virginia.tgw_arn, module.tgw_ohio.tgw_arn]


Do this:

tgw_arns = {
  virginia = module.tgw_virginia.tgw_arn
  ohio     = module.tgw_ohio.tgw_arn
}


‚úÖ This way:

Keys (virginia, ohio) are known at plan time.

Values (the TGW ARNs) can be computed at apply time.

No more "Invalid for_each argument" error.
